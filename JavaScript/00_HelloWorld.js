// Pro JavaScript Developer.

// JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight 
// and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow 
// client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is 
// an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.

// Client-Side JavaScript
// Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language. 
// The script should be included in or referenced by an HTML document 
// for the code to be interpreted by the browser.

// It means that a web page need not be a static HTML, but can include 
// programs that interact with the user, control the browser, and dynamically 
// create HTML content.
